title: How to code review?
draft:
---
In most cases, do not make code review mandatory.  
When people can deploy, they own it.  
When people own it, they care for it.

You should comment.  
Reviewing is a chance to learn together.  
Don't command, suggest and explain why.  
Do not comment on formatting, automate it.  

Make a big effort to post all comments at once.

In most cases, you should approve.  
Does this change make the system better? Then approve it.  
Does this change add a feature?  Then approve it.  
Does this change fix a bug? Then approve it.  
Do not slow down productivity for an opinion.  

The ultimate code review catches something that would break.  
Be a hero, find a real bug.
